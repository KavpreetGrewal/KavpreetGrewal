#### What I'm currently working on
I am currently working on building a recruitment tool for clubs at UBC Launch Pad with a team of developers and designers. The tool will help clubs streamline their recruitment process by providing a single place where they can view and grade applications, analyze analytics, and communicate with applicants. This is being developed with React and Node.js.

#### Projects
-->
I have currently developed [OnTrack](https://github.com/KavpreetGrewal/onTrack-TimeTracker) which is a useful flutter app for iOS and Android which makes time/hours tracking super easy. I've also developed a cool [browser extension](https://github.com/KavpreetGrewal/touchless-webpage-scroller) using TensorFlow handtracking, which allows users to scroll webpages without touching their devices! However, that's not all, along with additional updates to my current projects, I have many more interesting projects coming up soon, so stay tuned!
